## Overview
This project involved setting up and configuring Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS) in a Windows Server environment hosted in Microsoft Azure. This lab extends Part 1 and demonstrates the creation of domain accounts, joining client machines to the domain, and enabling Remote Desktop access for users.

---

## Environments and Technologies Used
- **Microsoft Azure**
  - Virtual Machines (DC-1 and Client-1)
  - Compute Resources
- **Windows Server**
  - Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS)
  - DNS Configuration
- **Remote Desktop**

---

## Operating Systems Used
- **Windows Server 2019**
- **Windows 10 (21H2)**

---

## List of Prerequisites
1. Azure subscription with Virtual Machines (VMs) for DC-1 and Client-1.
2. Client-1 DNS settings pointed to the DC-1 private IP address.
3. Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS) installed on DC-1.
4. PowerShell scripting capabilities.

---

## Project Steps

### **Part 1: Active Directory Setup**

1. **Log in to DC-1:**
   - Install the **Active Directory Domain Services** (ADDS) role.

   - Promote the server as a Domain Controller (DC).     
   - Set up a new forest named `mydomain.com` (replaceable with any domain name).

   - Restart and log back in as `mydomain.com\labuser`.

2. **Create a Domain Admin User:**
   - Open **Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)**.
   - Create Organizational Units (OUs):
     - `_EMPLOYEES`
     - `_ADMINS`
   - Add an employee named `Jane Doe` with username `jane_admin`.
   - Assign `jane_admin` to the **Domain Admins Security Group**.

   - Log out and log back in as `mydomain.com\jane_admin`.

3. **Join Client-1 to the Domain:**
   - Set Client-1's DNS settings to the DCâ€™s private IP address.
   - Restart Client-1 and join it to the domain `mydomain.com`.

   - Verify in ADUC that Client-1 appears under **Computers**.

   - Move Client-1 to a new OU named `_CLIENTS`.

4. **Finish the Lab:**
   - Shut down the VMs in Azure to save costs.

---

### **Part 2: Remote Desktop and Bulk User Creation**

1. **Enable Remote Desktop Access for Non-Admin Users:**
   - Log in to **Client-1** as `mydomain.com\jane_admin`.
   - Open System Properties > Remote Desktop.
   - Allow `Domain Users` to access Remote Desktop.

2. **Create Multiple Users Using PowerShell:**
   - Log in to **DC-1** as `jane_admin`.
   - Open PowerShell ISE as an administrator.
   - Create and run a script to bulk-create users.
     - Users are added to the `_EMPLOYEES` OU.
   - Verify in ADUC that the accounts were successfully created.

3. **Test User Accounts:**
   - Attempt to log in to **Client-1** using one of the newly created accounts.

4. **Wrap-Up:**
   - Ensure the VMs remain in Azure for future labs.
   - Shut down the VMs in Azure to save costs.
